# Content
This repository's purpose is to present some productions for my exam...

It is based on the [PyTorch-DP framework](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch-dp) (*frozen in the 19th of June, 2020 version. Under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch-dp/blob/master/LICENSE)*)

* A notebook that presents the budget computation of Differential Privacy with PyTorch-DP and links to articles for justifications. You can either [download it](https://github.com/jmg-74/exam/blob/master/torchdp/scripts/DP_Computation_in_SGM.ipynb) to use on your own server or run it online (quite slow to launch) thanks to [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jmg-74/exam/master?filepath=torchdp%2Fscripts%2FDP_Computation_in_SGM.ipynb)
* A attempt to convert "102-flowers" DL model to a DP version.
