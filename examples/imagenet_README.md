```
for dp enabled.

# Get smaller ImageNet samples

Since ImageNet is a big dataset, in order to experiment with *part of* the dataset, you can use the scripts under `/scripts` directory to make sampled version of ImageNet dataset.

Scripts:
* `make_small_imagebet_sampled.py`: *This script makes a sampled version of ImageNet, with all 1000 classes.* usage Example: *bash make_small_imagenet_N_classes.sh -o Documents/imagenet_full_size -d Documents/imagenet_small_100 -nt 100 -nv 10*
* `make_small_imagebet_N_classes.py`: *This script makes a smaller version of ImageNet, where only N classes are copied.* usage Example: *bash make_small_imagenet_N_classes.sh -o Documents/imagenet_full_size -d Documents/imagenet_small_50_classes -n 50*

# Study
We have done some tests to evaluate the different options for replacing BatchNorm modules, since they cannot be attached
to the privacy engine yet. For our tests we have used ImageNet with only 10 out of 1000 classes. Below are some of our results,
that lead us to use our modified version of GroupNorm instead of BatchNorm.

**base case: original resne18, nodp**

* *results:    Acc@1 61.000 Acc@5 95.000 at epoch 10 with accuracy getting slightly better at each epoch*
----
**with batchnorm replaced by groupnorm: affine = False**
no differential privacy
* *results:    Acc@1 24.400 Acc@5 73.400 at epoch 10 with accuracy getting slightly better at each epoch*
----
**with batchnorm replaced by groupnorm: affine = False**  + con2d1x1(non-depth)
no differential privacy
* *results:   Acc@1 32.000 Acc@5 82.400 at epoch 10 with accuracy getting slightly better at each epoch*

----
**with batchnorm replaced by groupnorm: affine = False**  + con2d1x1(depth-wise)
no differential privacy
* *results:   Acc@1 31.800 Acc@5 79.200 at epoch 10 with accuracy getting slightly better at each epoch*
---
**with batchnorm replaced by groupnorm: affine = False** + con2d1x1(depth-wise) + initialize weights to 1 and bias to 0
no differential privacy


* Acc@1 Acc@1 55.200 Acc@5 93.200 with learning rate 0.025 no warm-up
---

**with batchnorm replaced by groupnorm: affine = True**
no differential privacy


* Acc@1 55.600 Acc@5 93.200  with learning rate 0.025 no warm-up

------------
**with batchnorm replaced by groupnorm: affine = False**
*with differential privacy*
* *Results: Acc@1 16.800 Acc@5 60.000  at epoch 8 model diverging slowly after epoch eight probably need to lower the learning rate*
